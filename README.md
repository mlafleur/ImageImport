ImageImport
===========

Image Import for Windows 10 is a utility for importing photos from a camera or storage devices.  

For many years, I used Windows Live Essentialâ€™s Photo Gallery to manage my photos. The Photos app that ships with Windows is excellent, but its import functionality is lacking compared to the old desktop Photo Gallery. Specifically, it lacks the ability to remove photos from the camera or device during the import process.

Without this feature importing photos is a 2 step process, first import and then manually delete the images off the memory card. Image Import provides an improved import experience with the ability to remove photos automatically.
