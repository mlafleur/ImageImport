ImageImport
===========

Image Import for Windows 8.1 is a utility for importing photos from a camera or storage devices.  

For many years now I’ve used Windows Live Essential’s Photo Gallery to manage my photos. While it still works great with Windows 8.1, it won’t run on Windows RT and is frankly starting to look rather dated. The Photos app that ships with Windows 8.1 is an excellent replacement but its import functionality is lacking compared to the old desktop Photo Gallery. Specifically, it lacks the ability to remove photos from the camera or device during the import process. 

Without this feature importing photos is a 2 step process, first import and then manually delete the images off the memory card. Image Import provides an improved import experience with the ability to remove photos automatically.
